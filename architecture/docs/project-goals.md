# SmartVolt AI — Project Goals

## 1. Engineering Clarity
Create a predictable AI-assisted system that supports engineering workflows:
- Electrical design
- Automation logic
- Smart home infrastructure
- Building and hotel automation projects

## 2. System Architecture
Formalize a multi-layer architecture:
- Core (models)
- Orchestration (n8n + pipelines)
- Interface (assistants, robots)
- Tools (AutoCAD, Visio, scripts)
- External memory

## 3. Safety & Responsibility
- AI does not make critical decisions  
- Human remains the operator  
- All actions are logged  
- Fallback safe mode is mandatory  

## 4. Practical Real-World Use
System must work in real engineering projects:
- Apartments and houses (Smart Home)
- Hotels and hospitality automation
- Theaters, scenography, dynamic lighting
- Commercial spaces (malls, offices)
- Technical infrastructure monitoring

## 5. Scalability
System must evolve:
- From single-user tools → to multi-room → to building-scale  
- From simple workflows → to fully automated engineering portals  
- Support modular expansion and custom logic  

## 6. Long-Term Goal
Build a universal engineering AI framework that can assist:
- Designers  
- Electricians  
- Integrators  
- Automation specialists  
- Hotel and facility managers  

This framework becomes the foundation for future SmartVolt systems.
