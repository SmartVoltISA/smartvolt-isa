# SmartVolt AI Architecture — Overview

This repository contains the structured multi-layer architecture for SmartVolt AI system.  
The design follows safety-first principles, predictable behaviour, controlled memory and human-approved actions.

---

## Purpose
- Provide a clear architectural baseline.  
- Separate orchestration, logic, interfaces and tools.  
- Create a foundation for future automation and local deployment.  
- Maintain transparency and auditability.

---

## Structure
- **architecture/** — core architecture documents.  
- **system-design/** — foundational CID model and system logic.  
- **docs/** — high-level documentation, roadmap, system maps.  

---

## Key Design Values
- Human responsibility above automation.  
- Multi-layer separation of concerns.  
- Strict orchestration boundaries.  
- No autonomous critical decisions.  
- Stable predictable behaviour.

## Current Status
Architecture drafted.  
Next steps — detailing layers, building system map and automation flows.
